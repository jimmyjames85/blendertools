# Just so you know, You should always size your holes with proper
# clearance in your models. A 20mm hole for a 20mm part is a "size
# on size" press fit. Adding .02mm should be a snug press fit,
# 0.05mm would be a tight slip, 0.1mm a snug slip, and 0.15mm a
# free slip, and 0.4mm would give you a clearance fit for a
# bolt. Of course these dimensions vary somewhat as a percentage of
# the size of the object and the hole - (bigger needs slightly
# more), but generally a good rule of thumb.
#
# this may not be accurate, this could be affected by layer height
